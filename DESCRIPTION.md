# Business Capability Model Augmentation Process

## Overview

This document outlines a structured approach to enhancing business capability models by systematically decomposing leaf capabilities into actionable sub-capabilities. The methodology ensures strategic alignment, consistency, and scalability, providing architects with a robust framework for capability expansion and organizational analysis.

## Process Flow

### 1. Input Analysis
The process begins with analyzing structured capability models, which include hierarchical relationships, descriptions, and identifiers. Leaf nodes—capabilities without sub-capabilities—are identified as primary candidates for detailed expansion.

### 2. Context Building
For each leaf capability, a comprehensive context is constructed to ensure informed and strategic decomposition:
- **Full Tree Context**: Visualizes the entire capability hierarchy to maintain organizational coherence.
- **Parent Hierarchy**: Highlights the lineage of parent capabilities, ensuring alignment with overarching objectives.
- **Sibling Context**: Considers related capabilities at the same level to avoid redundancy and ensure complementarity.
- **Current Capability**: Focuses on the specific capability being expanded, ensuring depth and relevance.

### 3. Intelligent Prompting
A structured prompt template guides the analytical process, emphasizing:
- **MECE Principles**: Ensuring sub-capabilities are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.
- **Strategic Alignment**: Maintaining alignment with organizational goals and value propositions.
- **Consistency Standards**: Enforcing uniform abstraction levels and detail across capabilities.
- **Stakeholder Relevance**: Identifying key inputs, outputs, and responsible parties for each capability.

### 4. Structured Analysis Framework
The framework enforces a disciplined approach to capability decomposition:
- Development of internal checklists to ensure systematic analysis.
- Context-aware expansion that respects existing sibling capabilities.
- Verification of alignment with parent capability objectives.
- Assessment of business value for each proposed sub-capability.

### 5. Standardized Output Generation
The output adheres to a strict format, ensuring clarity and usability:
- **Business Description**: A concise explanation of scope, purpose, and outcomes.
- **Operational Details**: Structured sections detailing inputs, outputs, and stakeholders.
- **Technical Context**: Optional sections addressing enabling technologies and industry standards.
- **Validation**: Ensures no duplication or overlap with existing capabilities.

### 6. Quality Assurance
The process incorporates rigorous validation steps to ensure output quality:
- Compliance with schema requirements (e.g., UUID format, mandatory fields).
- Integrity checks for parent-child relationships and duplicate IDs.
- Reliability checks to track errors and save progress.

Note: Adherence to MECE principles and business value assessment is embedded in the prompt design, ensuring analytical rigor.

## Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Efficiently processes entire capability hierarchies, enabling large-scale organizational analysis.
- **Consistency**: Maintains uniformity in formatting and analytical depth across all expansions.
- **Strategic Focus**: Prioritizes organizational value and alignment with strategic goals.
- **Flexibility**: Allows customization of expansion depth and analytical parameters to suit specific needs.
- **Traceability**: Retains all original capability attributes and relationships, ensuring a clear audit trail.

## Output Characteristics

The augmented capability model enhances the original structure by adding detailed sub-capabilities. Each expansion includes:
- Business-focused descriptions that articulate scope and strategic relevance.
- Operational context, including inputs, outputs, and stakeholder roles.
- Validation of strategic alignment and organizational value.
