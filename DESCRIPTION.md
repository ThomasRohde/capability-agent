# Business Capability Model Augmentation Process

## Overview

This process enhances business capability models by intelligently decomposing leaf capabilities into comprehensive sub-capabilities. The approach reads existing capability hierarchies, applies structured business analysis, and generates detailed expansions that maintain consistency and strategic alignment.

## Process Flow

### 1. Input Analysis
The process accepts capability models as structured data containing hierarchical business capabilities. Each capability includes identification, naming, description, and parent-child relationships. Leaf nodes (capabilities without sub-capabilities) are identified as candidates for expansion.

### 2. Context Building
For each leaf capability, comprehensive contextual information is constructed including:
- **Full Tree Context**: Complete capability hierarchy showing organizational structure
- **Parent Hierarchy**: Chain of parent capabilities from root to current node
- **Sibling Context**: Related capabilities at the same hierarchical level
- **Current Capability**: Detailed focus on the capability being expanded

### 3. Intelligent Prompting
A sophisticated prompt template guides the analysis process with specific instructions for:
- **MECE Principles**: Ensuring sub-capabilities are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive
- **Business Alignment**: Maintaining strategic intent and organizational value
- **Consistency Standards**: Applying uniform abstraction levels and detail consistency
- **Stakeholder Consideration**: Identifying relevant inputs, outputs, and responsible parties

### 4. Structured Analysis Framework
The prompt template enforces a rigorous analytical approach requiring:
- Internal checklist development for systematic thinking
- Context-aware decomposition respecting existing sibling capabilities
- Strategic alignment verification with parent capability objectives
- Business value assessment for each proposed sub-capability

### 5. Standardized Output Generation
Generated sub-capabilities follow a strict format including:
- **Business Description**: Two-paragraph explanation covering scope, purpose, and outcomes
- **Operational Details**: Structured sections for inputs, outputs, and stakeholders
- **Technical Context**: Optional sections for enabling technologies and industry standards
- **Validation**: Ensures no duplication or overlap with existing capabilities

### 6. Quality Assurance
All generated content is validated through:
- Schema compliance verification (UUID format, required fields)
- Parent-child relationship integrity checking
- Duplicate ID detection and data integrity validation
- Processing reliability checks (error tracking, progress saving)

Note: MECE principle adherence and business value assessment are guided through prompt design rather than programmatic validation.

## Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Processes entire capability hierarchies efficiently (though individual capabilities could be analyzed manually through direct interaction)
- **Consistency**: Maintains uniform formatting and analytical rigor across all expansions
- **Business Focus**: Emphasizes organizational value and strategic alignment over technical implementation
- **Flexibility**: Configurable parameters for expansion depth and analytical scope
- **Traceability**: Preserves all original capability attributes and relationships

## Output Characteristics

The augmented capability model retains all original structure while adding comprehensive sub-capability detail. Each expansion includes business-focused descriptions, operational context, stakeholder identification, and strategic alignment validation, creating a complete enterprise capability view suitable for strategic planning and organizational analysis.
