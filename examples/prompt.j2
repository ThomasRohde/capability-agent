You are given a business capability model. Generate up to {{ max_capabilities }} sub-capabilities for the leaf node below.

Requirements:
- Output a JSON array only, inside a Markdown ```json code block.
- Each item must have fields: name (string), description (string).
- Keep names concise and distinct.
- Avoid duplicates and overlaps with existing siblings.

Leaf Node:
{{ node | tojson(indent=2) }}

{% if parent is defined %}
Parent:
{{ parent | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

{% if siblings is defined %}
Siblings:
{{ siblings | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

{% if full_tree is defined %}
Full Tree:
{{ full_tree | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

Respond strictly as:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Capability 1",
    "description": "Capability 1 description"
  }
]
```
